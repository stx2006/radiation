## Submitting a Pull Request (PR) 🛠️

Submitting a PR is easy! This example shows how to submit a PR for updating `requirements.txt` in 4 steps:

### 1. Select File to Update

Select `requirements.txt` to update by clicking on it in GitHub.

### 2. Click 'Edit this file'

The button is in the top-right corner.

### 3. Make Changes

Change the module from one version to another.

### 4. Preview Changes and Submit PR

Click on the **Preview changes** tab to verify your updates. At the bottom of the screen select 'Create a **new branch** for this commit', assign your branch a descriptive name such as `fix/matplotlib_version` and click the green **Propose changes** button. All done, your PR is now submitted to YOLOv5 for review and approval 😃!

### PR recommendations

To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:

- ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date** with `radiation` `main` branch. If your PR is behind you can update your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge master` locally.


- ✅ Verify all radiation Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.


- ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_ — Bruce Lee

## Submitting a Bug Report 🐛

If you spot a problem with radiation please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We've created a few short guidelines below to help users provide what we need to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a minimum reproducible example. Your code that reproduces the problem should be:

- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- ✅ **Complete** – Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

In addition to the above requirements, for us to provide assistance your code should be:

- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with the current GitHub [main](https://github.com/stx2006/radiation), and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone` a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this repository. We don't provide support for custom code ⚠️.

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛 **Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/stx2006/radiation/issues/new/choose) and provide a minimum reproducible example to help us better understand and diagnose your problem.
